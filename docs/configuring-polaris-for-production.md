# Configuring Polaris for Production

The default `polaris-server.yml` configuration is intended for develoment and testing. When deploying Polaris in production, there are several best practices to keep in mind.

## Security

### Configurations

There are many Polaris configurations that should be adjusted to ensure a secure Polaris deployment. Some of these configurations are briefly outlined below, along with a short description of each.

* **oauth2**
  - Configure [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/) with this setting, including a token broker

* **callContextResolver** & **realmContextResolver**
  - Use these configurations to specify a service that can resolve a realm from your bearer tokens.
  - The service(s) used here must implement the relevant interfaces (e.g. [CallContextResolver](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/blob/8290019c10290a600e40b35ddb1e2f54bf99e120/polaris-service/src/main/java/io/polaris/service/context/CallContextResolver.java#L27)).

* **authenticator.tokenBroker**
  - Ensure that this setting reflects the token broker specified in **oauth2** above

* **cors**
  - Use settings like **cors.allowed-origins** to control what connections your Polaris service will accept


## Metastore Management

Use the configuration `metaStoreManager` to configure a [MetastoreManager](https://github.com/polaris-catalog/polaris/blob/627dc602eb15a3258dcc32babf8def34cf6de0e9/polaris-core/src/main/java/io/polaris/core/persistence/PolarisMetaStoreManager.java#L47) implementation where Polaris entities will be persisted. 

The default `in-memory` implementation is meant for testing and not suitable for production usage. Instead, consider an implementation such as `eclipse-link` which allows you to store metadata in a remote database.

Credentials and metadata will be stored in the metastore manager, and so be sure that your metastore manager is accordingly secured.

### Configuring EclipseLink

To use [EclipseLink](https://eclipse.dev/eclipselink/) for metastore management, specify the configuration `metaStoreManager.conf-file` to point to an [EclipseLink `persistence.xml` file](https://eclipse.dev/eclipselink/documentation/2.5/solutions/testingjpa002.htm). This file, local to the Polaris service, will contain information on what database to use for metastore management and how to connect to it.

### Bootstrapping

Before using Polaris when using a metastore manager other than `in-memory`, you must **bootstrap** the metastore manager. This is a manual operation that must be performed **only once** in order to prepare the metastore manager to integrate with Polaris. When the metastore manager is bootstrapped, any existing Polaris entities in the metastore manager may be **purged**.

To bootstrap Polaris, run a command like the following:

```bash
java -jar /path/to/jar/snowflake-polaris-all.jar bootstrap polaris-server.yml
```

Afterwards, you can launch Polaris normally with a command like the following:

```bash
java -jar /path/to/jar/snowflake-polaris-all.jar server polaris-server.yml
```

## Other Configurations

When deploying Polaris in production, consider adjusting the following configurations:

* **featureConfiguration.SUPPORTED_CATALOG_STORAGE_TYPES**
  - By default, the `FILE` storage type may be supported. This is intended for testing, and in produciton you'll likely want to disable it
  - Here you can also disable or enable any other storage type based on your expected usage of Apache Iceberg
